# CodeChallenge2022

Pc Recommender:
A website that aims to recommend PC builds depending on user inputs. The data used is web scraped from amazon,
which can be updated manually, to ensure prices are as close as possible to the real time prices.

Unfortunately, I was not able to compile this program into an executable, despite many attempts. The installation and
running instructions may be tedious.
More detailed instructions can be found in PcRecommender.docx

I also have hosted the website only side on heroku.com, at:

'https://pc-recommender.herokuapp.com/' (Deprecated)

Github: 'https://github.com/Tsangington/Pc-Recommender'

Pre-requisites/ Installation instructions:

Install node.js (comes with npm) from this website:'https://nodejs.org/en/download/'

Download this file into a directory. 

Open a command prompt leading to said directory. 

Run the commands:

'npm init' and change the metadata as you wish.

'npm install puppeteer' *This may take a while*.

'npm install express'

Once these are done, change the code as necessary if you want to test functionality.When you want to run the server.js file,

Type 'npm start' in the command prompt. The website will be hosted on 'localhost:3000',

and the webscraper data will be shown in the cmd.
